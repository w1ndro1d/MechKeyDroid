C# application that runs in system tray, listens for keypress and makes mechanical keyboard noises as you type. Pair this app with a noise cancelling headphone and you will enjoy typing even the dullest of contents! 

Type of noise and keypress volumes are adjustable in realtime. Currently supports 10 types of sounds: Default, NK-Cream, Turquoise Tealio, Topre, Alpaca, Gateron InkBlack, BlueAlps, BoxNavy, Buckling, HolyPanda and CherryMX Black. Feel free to add your own sounds! You can also choose to make noise on mouse clicks!(why would you want a mouse with a mechanical switch? that's what I want to know too :P)
