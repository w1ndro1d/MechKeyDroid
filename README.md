C# application that runs in system tray, listens for keypress and makes mechanical keyboard noises as you type. Pair this app with a noise cancelling headphone and you will enjoy typing even the dullest of contents! 

Keypress volume is adjustable in realtime using the slider provided. Currently supports two types of sounds: Default(becomes monotonous easily) and NK-Cream. Feel free to add your own sounds! You can also choose to make noise on mouse clicks!(why would you want a mouse with a mechanical switch? that's what I want to know too :P)
